% FUNCTION:    GA_probabilistic_AP_selection
% DESCRIPTION: Estimation-of-Distribution-like Genetic Algorithm (EDA/GA) 
%              for selecting a subset of Access Points (APs) that maximizes 
%              UE coverage in a cell-free massive MIMO network.
%
% INPUTS:
%   RSRP_matrix               - [N_comb x N_UE] precomputed RSRP values 
%                               (dBm), where rows correspond to AP 
%                               combinations and columns to UEs
%   L                         - Total number of APs
%   M                         - Number of APs to select in each solution
%   numGenerations            - Maximum number of generations
%   threshold                 - RSRP threshold (dBm), e.g., -90
%   required_coverage_percent - Minimum coverage to consider solution 
%                               valid (0â€“1)
%   popSize                   - Population size per generation
%   alpha                     - Learning rate for probability update (0â€“1, 
%                               e.g., 0.2)
%   patience                  - Early stopping patience (# generations 
%                               without improvement)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   result = struct with fields:
%       .best_combination   - Best set of AP indices found
%       .best_coverage      - Best coverage ratio achieved
%       .coverage_percent   - Same as best_coverage (alias)
%       .generations_run    - Number of generations executed
%       .generation_found   - First generation when valid solution is found
%       .fitness_history    - Max fitness per generation
%       .avg_rsrp_history   - Avg RSRP across population per generation
%       .coverage_history   - Avg coverage across population per generation
%       .total_evaluations  - Total number of evaluated individuals
%       .p                  - Final learned AP selection probability vector
%
% NOTES:
%   - Starts with uniform AP selection probability (M/L).
%   - Updates probabilities based on elite (top 20%) solutions.
%   - Maintains exactly M selected APs per individual.
%   - Uses patience-based early stopping.
